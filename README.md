## Hello there, 
My name is FinnsterB and I am an Embedded Software Development
student from the Netherlands. For now my repository is just
for some of the stuff I'm trying. I like to code for Arduino
and other Atmel devices. 

I'm still learning most of what I do so don't expect too much 
from my code yet....

So far I can code in Java, C, HTML, CSS, PHP and a bit of JS.

Some of my personal hobbies include playing guitar, 3d Printing
and working on cars.
